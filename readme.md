# Disclaimer: Do not use any macros here or elsewhere, otherwise your account has the risk of being banned.

This repository will include essential destiny 2 macros, feel free to change them to your liking.
I will have more macros soon.
All macros are written in AutoHotKeyScript, make sure to download the AutoHotKey software. It's opensource and free: https://autohotkey.com
Feel free to change the macro keybinds, which can be done by editing the, example, Numpad1:: to Numpad0:: . For a full list of ahk keys, see here: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm

I am in no way responsible if you get banned using these, use it at your own risk. ~~However, I think Bungie is leniant and doesn't usually ban you for macros~~. So much for that leniancy :p

# Latest Update:

## 2022-07-31
- Added wellskate.ahk

# List of current macros:
- (*Deprecated*) Double Slug (To use, first place 2 anarchy shots, then switch to your ENERGY weapon. It will automatically ADS. Requires 2 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+4)
- (*Deprecated*) Quad Swapping (To use, be ready with your Xenophage. It will automatically ADS. Requires 1 machine gun and 1 shotgun dexterity. Keybind: Ctrl+5)
- Anti-AFK (To use, be ready with any weapon, preferably a weapon with lots of ammo. Note: Uneven terrain may cause slight issues with ads coordinates. Keybind: Alt+4)
- (**Deprecated But Functional**) Thrallway AFK (To use, you need to be a warlock and have Trinity Ghoul equipped w/ catalyst. Melee resist is recommended, as well as double bow scavenger and finder. This can work with both thrallways, either the 1st or 2nd. To start, go to your usual spot you use to farm. You have two options: use devour, or sanguine alchemy, or both. If using devour, make sure to proc devour before macro usage. If using sanguine alchemy, make sure to place rift down before macro usage. Make sure to have lightning rod active before macro usage. As always kill switch is 0. Keybind: Numpad 0)
- (**Deprecated But Functional Replace With Eager Edge Sword**) Hunter Skate (To use, you must be on a hunter, duh, and use stasis subclass. Make sure to have the shatterdive aspect equipped as well. For this to work, you will also have to equip the Worldline Zero heavy exotic sword. Stomp-EE5 exotic boots are recommended to ensure maximum skating efficiency. If you don't know how to skate, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRmVcdsSwOA. To use this macro, before performing your heavy attack, instead press the macro button. This may not work with some terrains, so you may have to be more closer to the edge of the elevated terrain or less, it will depend. Press (1 or multiple times, depending on jump choice) space to jump even further, this has not been built in to the macro to not create any unnecessary keystrokes that the user may not want. Keybind: 4)
- Moon Hallway AFK (Must be a titan running Ashen Wake fusion grenades. Solar 3.0 aspects include Consecretion and Roaring Flames. We do not want sunspots since that messes up the farm a bit. This place for the afk xp farm will be on the moon in the Hall of Wisdom area accessed through the temple in Archer's Line. The area looks like the eye of a giant servitor and it has a big tunnel. There will be some ads there so clear all of them. Standing at the entrance of that large tunnel will trigger the ads to respawn, and that's where we are going to stand AFK at. Position yourself such that your fusion grenade is able to kill all the ads before they seperate. This may require a bit of precise positioning. Once set manually kill the ads by tossing a fusion nade right when they spawn. To get ready, notice the roaring flames timer, when it reaches 16 seconds, turn on the macro. Follow video guide for further explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3aaPdVWdpk. Press 0 to stop the macro. Keybind: Numpad 0.)
- Well Skate (Use while running off a ledge. Player must be right before falling off the ledge in order for the macro to work. Ensure that you are using a well warlock, eager edge sword and have a primary or energy weapon equipped before using macro. Burst glide and 100 mobility to get maximum distance. Alternative to hunter skate. Keybind: Numpad 0)
- more soon...
